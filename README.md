# 🧮 FCFS CPU Scheduling Simulation in Python  
**By Tahim Bhuiya**

This project implements a **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) CPU Scheduling Algorithm** with support for **I/O bursts** in Python. It simulates the execution of processes with alternating CPU and I/O bursts, and computes performance metrics like **waiting time**, **turnaround time**, **response time**, and **CPU utilization**.

---

## 📜 Overview

This simulation models how an operating system schedules processes using the **FCFS non-preemptive algorithm**, where:

- Each process has a list of CPU bursts and I/O times  
- Processes execute their bursts in order  
- I/O-bound processes are temporarily removed from the ready queue  
- Time is advanced to simulate actual scheduling with idle gaps when needed  
- Metrics are tracked for all processes

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run the Python file directly:

```bash
python FCFS (Non-Preemptive) Scheduler.py
```

Then observe the simulation output in the terminal, including:

- Real-time status updates (e.g. which process is running or in I/O)  
- Completion logs for each process  
- A table with waiting, turnaround, and response times  
- CPU utilization and average performance metrics

## 📈 Example Output

```
Current Execution Time: 93
Running Process: P1
Ready Queue: [(3, 8), (4, 3), (6, 11), (5, 16), (7, 14), (8, 4)]
Processes in I/O: [(2, 24)]

Process P1 has completed its total execution.

Results at the end of the simulation:
Total time needed to complete all processes: 980
CPU Utilization: 81.24%

Process     Tw        Ttr         Tr        
P1          63        198         0         
P2          112       312         12        
...

Average     84.75     256.50      15.38
```

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- No external libraries (only built-in `collections.deque` is used)

---

## ✅ Notes

- This simulation assumes all processes **arrive at time 0**.  
- I/O operations are **blocking**, meaning the process leaves the CPU and re-enters only after I/O finishes.  
- Ready queue follows **strict FCFS** — no priority or preemption.  
- You can customize processes by modifying the `burst_times` and `io_times` lists.

## 🛠️ How to Customize

To simulate different workloads, change or add `Process` objects in the code:

```python
# Example:
p9 = Process(9, [5, 10, 6], [12, 15])
processes.append(p9)
```
